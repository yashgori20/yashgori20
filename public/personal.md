# Yash Nilesh Gori — Complete Personal & Professional Knowledge Base

**Last Updated:** October 2025  
**Context:** This is your personal tracker + career compass — capturing your journey, learnings, skills, positioning, and next steps.

---

## SECTION 1: CORE IDENTITY & POSITIONING

### Who You Are
- **Title:** AI Product IC (Individual Contributor with product leadership exposure)
- **Core Hybrid:** AI Engineer × Product Manager — you bridge technical depth with product thinking
- **Work Style:** Builder-first, curious, hands-on — you learn by making things, not reading about them
- **Sweet Spot:** Early-stage AI-driven startups where you can own problems end-to-end (0→1)

### What Excites You
- **Not:** Isolated engineering or pure theory
- **Yes:** Understanding user problems → building solutions → shipping products → gathering feedback → iterating
- **Philosophy:** "If I don't know how something works, I'll learn it until I do."

---

## SECTION 2: THE HONEST REALIZATION (Your Biggest Learning)

### The Coding Reality Check
**Context:** Your resume looks impressive, but it relies heavily on GPT-powered code generation.

**The Problem You Identified:**
- You can't confidently write a 10-line Python script from scratch
- You understand systems and architecture, but not the fundamentals
- You're worried: "If I keep doing this, I'll be jobless very soon"

**Why It Matters:**
- Companies don't just want someone who can generate code — they want someone who understands *why* it works
- Debugging, reading others' code, modifying it — these require actual knowledge
- You need to break this dependency to be real, not just look impressive

### Your Commitment to Fix It
**The Plan (Project-Based Learning):**
1. Pick a project that excites you (not boring theory)
2. Write messy code first, refactor later
3. Learn just-in-time (when bugs force you to understand)
4. Use Thonny IDE (visual debugging that explains itself)
5. Celebrate micro-wins and build through doing

**Why This Works for You:**
- You're not a "memorize data types" person
- You learn through curiosity + obsession with a problem
- Real projects stick; tutorials don't

**Next Steps:**
- Build 3-5 small backend projects from scratch (no GPT shortcuts)
- Focus on debugging and code reading, not generating
- Aim to be job-ready (able to code live, explain architecture, handle problems independently)

## SECTION 5: PROJECTS (RESUME & PORTFOLIO)

### ChargeOrFill — EV Charging Aggregator App  
**Role:** Founder / Product Lead  
**Status:** Concept & Research Validation  

**Resume Version (2 bullets):**
- Conceived and led a 0→1 product to unify EV charging networks across Mumbai after observing rising adoption but fragmented user experience (each brand had its own app)
- Conducted extensive research using on-ground interviews, online surveys, competitive benchmarking, and root-cause analysis frameworks; designed complete Figma prototype
- **Key Finding:** ~80% of EV users charged at home or in private facilities → validated lack of B2C product-market fit, prompting pivot toward B2B fleet solutions

**Portfolio Version (Full Story):**  
*Problem:* Rising EV adoption in 2021 Mumbai, but users faced friction discovering and managing multiple charging apps (Ather, Statiq, Tata Power). No unified interface existed.

*Research Approach:*
- On-ground interviews with EV owners, showroom managers, station vendors
- Online surveys + EV forums (Reddit, Facebook groups)
- Competitive benchmarking (Ather Grid, Statiq, Tata Power EZ, Chargeup)
- Root-cause analysis: Why do EV owners struggle?

*Insight:* 80% charged at home or private facilities → individual aggregator wasn't the pain point. Opportunity lay in fleet/B2B.

*Solution:* Designed Figma wireframes for aggregator UI, planned stakeholder outreach for station owners, modeled revenue through commissions.

*Outcome:* Validated learning on product-market fit, go/no-go decision-making, and market research frameworks.

## SECTION 10: SESSION PREP — SACHIN KR. SHUKLA (Paid Mentor Session)

### Why This Session Matters
You're not just paying for coding advice — you're paying for a peek behind the curtain:
1. How he built his career (without conventional company pedigree)
2. How he leveraged social media as an asset (50k Instagram followers)
3. How those two threads (skills + brand) combine into real opportunities

### Questions to Ask

**Part 1: Coding & Backend Mastery**
- "If I have heavy GPT dependency but want to code independently, what's your approach to breaking that?"
- "How much time should I spend on fundamentals (DSA, Python drills) vs. building AI/product features?"
- "What's the minimum backend foundation I need before applying for AI PM/engineer roles?"
- "When you learned backend + AI coding, what daily/weekly practice gave the best ROI?"

**Part 2: Full-Stack AI Engineer Path**
- "What does full-stack AI engineer mean to you? Which components (backend, AI/ML, frontend, infra) should I prioritize?"
- "How do you test if you're truly 'job-ready' vs. just able to patch projects together?"
- "Which project ideas do you think are high-signal for recruiters in AI backend roles?"

**Part 3: Social Media & Brand Leverage**
- "Did your Instagram/social media presence directly lead to offers, or is it just community building?"
- "If I start documenting my AIML learning publicly, what should my unique angle be?"
- "Do you recommend sharing raw struggles + fixes, or only polished knowledge?"
- "What ratio (coding vs. content) makes sense if I split time between both?"

**Part 4: The Big Question**
- "If you had to start over with my exact situation — built projects with GPT help, weak Python fundamentals — would you focus 100% on getting technically strong first, or balance coding + building an online learning presence?"

### What to Bring
- 1 concrete code example (from DocuTalk or Webotix) that you don't fully understand
- Ask him to walk through debugging it, line by line
- Share your 3-month plan for coding practice and ask for his critique

## SECTION 11: KEY REMINDERS

### Your Superpower
You understand the **intersection** — not just AI engineering, not just product management, but *how they work together*. That's rare. Own it.

### Your Weakness (And How You're Fixing It)
You've relied on code generation instead of building from scratch. You know this. You're committed to fixing it. That self-awareness is actually your strength.

### Your Next Move
Don't apply for "AI Engineer" roles. Don't apply for "PM" roles. Apply for "AI Product IC" or "AI Product Manager" roles in GenAI companies. That's where your hybrid skills shine.

### The Narrative
You're not switching careers — you're evolving within one. Engineer → AI Product Lead → AI Product Manager. It's a natural arc.

SECTION 13: PERSONAL INSIGHTS & SELF-REFLECTIONS (APM FORM CONTEXT)
Risk Appetite

I once pitched and demoed SwiftCheck, my unfinished AI product, to investors and enterprise clients. The system was still rough and could have failed live, but I decided to go ahead because I believed progress beats perfection. That moment taught me how to stay calm under pressure and back my conviction even when outcomes are uncertain. The risk paid off — we secured Microsoft AI Hub funding and validated the product’s direction.

View on Money vs. Power

I value power more than money — not the flashy kind, but the kind that lets you shape ideas and decisions. Money opens doors; power lets you change what’s behind them.

Thinking Style

I’m calculative by nature. My product and AI background trained me to think in hypotheses, frameworks, and trade-offs. I treat decisions like experiments — controlled, testable, and measurable. Even while applying for roles, I’ve followed a framework-driven approach rather than random outreach, iterating and learning along the way.

Speed vs. Perfection

I aim for the midpoint — build fast, refine what matters. Perfection without speed kills learning; speed without reflection kills quality. My approach is “build → test → polish.”

Education Philosophy

I believe the institute shapes growth more than the course. A strong environment accelerates learning through exposure, peers, and opportunities. The name itself doesn’t matter; the ecosystem does.

Procrastination Pattern

I tend to delay sharing my AI journey publicly. I want to document and teach but hold back fearing it won’t meet my own standards. I’m learning to prioritize consistency over polish — because real impact requires visibility.

Triggers & Patience

I rarely get angry when someone’s genuinely trying. I only lose patience with repeated carelessness or when people rely on others for what they can easily do themselves. Still, I consciously channel that frustration into helping them take ownership instead of stepping in myself.

Handling Intimidation

I felt genuinely intimidated during my first strategy meetings at Webotix, presenting AI workflows to the CEO and external partners. I realized quickly that clarity mattered more than perfection. That insight shifted fear into responsibility.

Self-Doubt Moments

Before pitching an AI architecture to Al Baik, I questioned whether I’d be able to explain it confidently. Preparation silenced that doubt — the proposal was well-received and reaffirmed my belief that clarity beats overconfidence.

How I’m Perceived

My harshest critic would probably say I take things too seriously or overanalyze situations. They wouldn’t be wrong — I care deeply about doing things well, which sometimes reads as rigidity.

Core Life Lessons

Giving up is the only real failure; bad outcomes are just data.

People remember how you make them feel, not what you achieve.

Change is constant — adapt instead of resisting.

New Learnings

Recently, I’ve been learning MMA. What started as fitness became a lesson in discipline and composure. I also began using Jira to structure my project management workflows — it’s helping me track tasks like code commits, product bugs, and experiments far more cleanly.

Next-Year Vision

A year from now, I’ll be celebrating landing an APM role where I can build AI-driven products while being fully independent technically. That’s been my long-term pursuit — merging AI engineering depth with product ownership.

If Judgment Didn’t Exist

If nobody judged, I’d post my full AI learning journey online — raw experiments, bugs, and breakdowns included — to show the unfiltered process of learning. It’s what I already do privately; I just hesitate to publish it.

Self-Worth

I’d rate my self-worth at 8/10. I know my potential and I’ve proven my capabilities, but I also take time to recharge and live slowly when needed. That balance keeps me sharp long-term.

Untapped Talent

Teaching. I have a knack for simplifying AI and product concepts but rarely use it beyond team discussions. Making that more public would both help others and deepen my understanding.

Energy Sources

I draw energy from calm — beaches, solo drives, quiet thinking days — and from intellectually charged spaces like GrowthX Club meetups. That mix of solitude and community keeps me balanced.

Daily Rhythm

Wake up around 7:30 AM, gym by 9:30, lunch at 2:30, then coding or exploring product ideas. Evenings are for swimming, relaxation, and applications. Sleep goal: 12–1:30 AM. Full but balanced.

Strength Zone

I’m best at connecting AI’s technical depth with human empathy. I can understand complex systems and still translate them into intuitive, helpful user experiences. That’s where I operate best — where logic meets understanding.
---

## FINAL NOTE

This document is your living compass. Update it as you:
- Learn new frameworks or tools
- Ship new projects
- Have important realizations
- Refine your goals

Use it to write resumes, prepare for interviews, and remind yourself of your journey when things feel uncertain.

You've built real systems. You've secured real funding. You understand both the technical and product sides.

**Your next move is clear: strengthen coding fundamentals, then step into AI PM roles where your hybrid skills become your unfair advantage.**
